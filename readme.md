:::

This repository contains a main package `hvac`, which will be further expanded in the future, containing a number of subpackages related to the field of HVAC engineering. If you want to use these Python packages in your own projects, please go ahead. The easiest way to get the package is to download this repository as a ZIP file by clicking the **Code** button above and selecting **Download ZIP**. The third-party libraries that need to be installed in your Python (virtual) environment are listed in the file *requirements.txt*.

The application of the packages will be demonstrated by subject in a number of Jupyter Books. Currently available are:
- [Vapor Compression Refrigeration Calculations with Python](https://tomlxxvi.github.io/Vapor-Compression-Refrigeration/)
- [Air Conditioning Calculations with Python](https://tomlxxvi.github.io/Air-Conditioning/)
- [Pipe and Duct Flow Calculations with Python](https://tomlxxvi.github.io/jbFluidFlow/intro.html)
